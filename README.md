# OOP-Lab-0

1. I installed Linux (Ubuntu 20.04), and because i would've been left with very little memory on my laptop if i installed dual boot, i decided to simply replace Windows with Linux. 

2. I installed all the essential tools: zsh, oh-my-zsh. I did all of it through the command line of the terminal.In my screenshots can be seen all the tasks and progress I made step by step, like for example installing the tools and configuring the oh-my-zsh to my own preferences. I chose to get a random theme every time i open my terminal, and i added a few plugins for autocompleting my input, and so on.

3. I installed Git and the GCC compiler/Makefile.I wrote a simple "Hello, world!" program and commited the changes. I pushed them to my remote repository on Github, all through the command line.
